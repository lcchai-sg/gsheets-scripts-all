# Calendaring User Choices from Multi-Choice Forms

### This script can be utilized with a multiple choice form, in order to add user selected event dates and times to the primary Google Calendar.

## PLEASE NOTE:
* Form option example - 'Thu, 06/07/18, 12:00 pm - 01:00 pm'
* The formatting for your form options must be VERY specific,
  * This is because there is no easy way to get a dateTime from a multi-choice form
